📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes Uber ride history data to extract meaningful insights into ride patterns, peak hours, fare trends, and travel purposes. Using Python’s pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries, the dataset is cleaned, explored, and visualized to understand customer travel behavior. A simple predictive model is also implemented to forecast ride demand trends.

🎯 Objectives
Preprocess and clean the dataset.

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

Identify peak ride hours, most frequent start/stop locations, and common travel purposes.

Analyze mileage trends over time.

Create visualizations for easy interpretation of insights.

Build a basic ride demand forecasting model.

📂 Dataset
The dataset contains Uber trip history with the following columns:

START_DATE* – Ride start date and time

END_DATE* – Ride end date and time

CATEGORY* – Ride type (Business / Personal)

START* – Pickup location

STOP* – Drop-off location

MILES* – Distance traveled

PURPOSE* – Purpose of travel

🛠️ Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python

Libraries Used: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

📊 Key Insights & Visualizations
